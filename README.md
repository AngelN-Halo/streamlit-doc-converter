# ðŸ“„ Streamlit Document Converter

This is a **web-based file converter** powered by [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) that lets you upload **images, PDFs, spreadsheets, Word docs, and EPUBs** and converts them to **Markdown** text for easy copy, editing, or download.

It uses:

- **Tesseract OCR** for image & scanned PDF text extraction
- **pdfplumber** for searchable PDFs
- **pandas** for CSV/XLSX handling
- **python-docx** for DOCX files
- **pypandoc** for EPUB and other format conversions

> **JPEG support is fully enabled** in our Docker build â€” even CMYK and sideways images should be readable thanks to auto-rotation and preprocessing.
