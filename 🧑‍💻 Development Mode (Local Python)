🧑‍💻 Development Mode (Local Python)
You must have Python 3.10+ and Tesseract OCR installed on your system. 
brew install tesseract pandoc poppler
Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng pandoc poppler-utils libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
Then:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py

⚙️ Project Structure
.
├── streamlit_app.py       # Main app code
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies (Pillow excluded - built in Docker)
├── Dockerfile             # Container build instructions
├── docker-compose.yml     # Service definition
└── shared/                # Optional: volume for uploaded files

🛠 Troubleshooting
JPEG fails to load
Check container logs right after start — you should see:
=== Pillow Debug Info ===
Pillow version: X.X.X
JPEG support: True
...
If JPEG support: False, ensure libjpeg-dev and zlib1g-dev are installed before Pillow is built.
Label warnings in Streamlit
Fixed: All widgets now have explicit labels.
HEIC/WebP files renamed to .jpg
These are not actually JPEGs; convert them to JPEG before uploading.
